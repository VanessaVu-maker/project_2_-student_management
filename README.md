# project_2_student_management-OOP-model

Program Functions: 

Write a program to manage Student's test score information with the following objects:
+ Student: (Student ID), Full name, Date of birth, Gender, Address, Phone number,
Email.
+ Subject: (Course code), Course name
+ Test scores: (Student ID, Subject code) is a combination of primary keys created by 2 foreign keys: Process Score, Final Score

Requirements: 

+ Create user interfaces in the terminal (users can move back and forth between screens):
- Main Menu screen: Display the list of program functions: 
Student Information Management screen
Course Information Management screen
Screen of Information Management Test Score
- Manage student information: Add/Edit/Delete/Search students
- Manage subject information: Add/Edit/Delete/Search for subjects

+ Manage exam score information: Enter scores/Edit scores/Delete scores/Look up scores by Student Code or Student's Full Name/Statistical list of Students by Score levels summation (A (90<=score<=100), B (70<=score<=90), C (50<=score<=70), D (score<=50)). Total score is calculated by this formula: Final score = (Process score + Final Score * 2) / 3
+ Export the transcript to CSV file
Output information includes: Student ID, Full Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Address, Number
Phone, Email, Subject Name, Progress Score, Final Score, Total Score

Note:
+ 3 objects Students, Subjects, Test scores can be understood as 3 data tables 
+ Data stored in .txt file. Each object is stored in a separate file. Example of storing the Student object in the file 'hocvien.txt'. Each record
on 1 line, the data fields are separated by the character |
+ Select the appropriate data type for each attribute field
+ Validate input data from keyboard, if not valid, the program will report an error and ask to re-enter
+ Properly handle exception

Advanced requirements:

+ Write Unit Test scripts 
+ Using OOP programming techniques, create classes corresponding to the tables in
MySQL. For example, the Student table in MySQL needs to create a Student class in Pythonâ€¦
+ Use the mysql-connector-python library to query MySQL from Python
+ Group objects into appropriate packages/modules (package is a directory,
module is a .py file, modules are programmed into classes according to OOP techniques). Import when needed
+ Display list data in tabular format. Use tabulate library for better display support:
